    Experienced Software Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, specializing in building 
    scalable, high-performance web applications with a focus on backend architecture and system functionality. 
    Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Information Technology at Deakin University, Melbourne. Beyond academics, 
    I have been freelancing, developing websites for local businesses, and building my own e-commerce platform, 
    <a href="https://mriid.com" className="text-bold text-white"> MRIID</a>, where I handle everything from backend 
    architecture to deployment. Previously, I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at 
    <a href="https://www.oneadvanced.com/" className="text-bold text-white"> OneAdvanced</a>, contributing to 
    large-scale enterprise applications.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    While I have experience across the stack, I find backend development particularly fascinating. Designing
    APIs, optimizing databases, and creating seamless integrations excites me more than UI design. I enjoy solving 
    complex problems and implementing scalable solutions.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-20">
  Beyond coding, Iâ€™m 
    passionate about reading, hiking, cycling, working out, and practicing martial arts. I believe discipline and 
    perseverance, both in physical training and software development, go hand in hand in shaping my approach to 
    challengesâ€”whether in technology or life.
